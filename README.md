## A simple one page app for business development tasks

[Live Demo: https://business-search.netlify.app/](https://business-search.netlify.app/)

### What?

This is the front end component of the business search app built with React and Gatsby, and deployed with Netlify.

The app itself simply takes a CSV as input and fetches addional business information via go lambda functions ([see backend here](https://github.com/tdarnett/business-search)). Once uploaded, you must enter in your payment information to receive the output via an email.

### Why?

A friend of mine wanted help automating a part of his business development tasks. Normally I'd just write a simple python script and be done with it, but I used this as an opportunity to work with new languages (to me).

### Getting started

install dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

start the development server:

```sh
yarn start
```
