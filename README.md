## A simple one page app for business development tasks

[Live Demo: https://gatsby-starter-saas-marketing.netlify.com/ ](https://gatsby-starter-saas-marketing.netlify.com/)

### What?

This is the front end component of the business search app built with React and Gatsby, and deployed with Netlify.

The app itself simply takes a CSV as input and fetches addional business information via go lambda functions (see backend here).

Once uploaded, you must enter in your payment information to receive the output via an email.

### Why?

A friend of mine wanted help automating a part of his business development tasks. Normally I'd just write a simple python script and be done with it, but I used this as an opportunity to work with new languages (to me).

### Getting started

install dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

start the development server:

```sh
yarn start
```
